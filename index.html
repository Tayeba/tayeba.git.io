                I'm a PhD student at the Bharti School of Telecommunication Technology and Management, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, where I am advised by Prof. Brejesh Lall. I am supported by the prestigious Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF), awarded by the Government of India. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and generative AI, with a current focus on the synthesis of thermal data and its applications in behavior and gesture recognition, particularly in autonomous systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the moment, I’m working on the following research directions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thermal data synthesis:</strong> How can we leverage generative models to synthesize high-fidelity thermal imagery, enabling robust vision models in low-visibility conditions?</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-modal representation learning:</strong> How can we align features between visible and thermal modalities to enhance performance in vision tasks under adverse environments?</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient perception for autonomous systems:</strong> How can we integrate behavior and gesture recognition into real-time, edge-deployable vision systems for autonomous driving?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Before starting my PhD, I completed my M.Tech in Robotics and Automation at IIT Delhi, jointly supervised by Prof. Brejesh Lall and Prof. N. R. Chauhan (IGDTUW, Delhi). My master’s thesis focused on visual object tracking in video sequences.

            <p>
                Prior to graduate school, I worked as a software developer at Infosys Ltd., and earned my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also actively contributing to a defense-focused research project in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Government of India.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to research, I enjoy exploring the intersection of science, systems, and society, and am particularly interested in the deployment of AI in real-world, mission-critical applications.
